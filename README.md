Deprecated fork of JODConverter from http://code.google.com/p/jodconverter/

The Nuxeo's jodconverter repository has been re-forked.
As explained by mirkonasato: << I started this project back in 2003, but I am no longer maintaining it. I moved the code here at GitHub in the hope that a well-maintained fork will emerge. >>, he finally pushed his project on GitHub. So we had to remove the initial manual fork from http://code.google.com/p/jodconverter/ to replace it with an automated fork from https://github.com/mirkonasato/jodconverter.

Sadly, this made us loose the issues history, forks and stars.
Issues have been manually rewritten. If you forked or stared https://github.com/nuxeo/jodconverter, you will have to do it again.
The original Nuxeo's jodconverter repository was renamed to https://github.com/nuxeo/jodconverter.bak. It will be later deleted.
